Examples manipulating HITRAN data with hselect and the unix
sort utility


Example 1: split out just the first four isotopes of water
-----------------------------------------------------------

First, we split the water data into individual isotopes

  hselect -i 1 g1.dat > g1.i1
  hselect -i 2 g1.dat > g1.i2
  hselect -i 3 g1.dat > g1.i3
  hselect -i 4 g1.dat > g1.i4
  hselect -i 5 g1.dat > g1.i5
  hselect -i 6 g1.dat > g1.i6

Then merge just the first 4 isotopes, and sort by wavenumber

  sort -n -t: -k1.4,1.15 g1.i1 g1.i2 g1.i3 g1.i4 > g1.new

Finally, delete the isotopes we just merged, keeping just 5 and 6.

  rm g1.i1 g1.i2 g1.i3 g1.i4


Example 2: update the database with some new data 
---------------------------------------------------

Merge all the old individual gas files

  sort -n -t: -k1.4,1.15 test1/g*.dat > test1.all

Add the update

  sort -u -t: -k1.1,1.3 -k1.68 newtothmod.txt test1.all > test1.new

resort the results by wavenumber

  sort -n -t: -k1.4,1.15 test1.new > test1.srt

Split the result back into gasses, dropping everything
below 400 and above 3000 1/cm.

  /asl/bin/hselect -b -L 400 -U 3000 test1.srt test1.dir

Note that updates for a single gas can be done directly to that
gas; in that case there is no need to build and then re-divide a
single, combined database.
