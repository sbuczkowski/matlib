This distribution includes a Matlab HITRAN reader,some tools for
manipulating HITRAN files, and examples of using the Unix "sort"
utility to merge, update, or sort a HITRAN database.

The main pieces are

  read_hitr.txt    - more detiled information
  read_hitran2.m   - reference version Matlab HITRAN reader
  read_hitran.c    - fast C mex version of Matlab HITRAN reader
  hselect.c        - C source for the select utility
  CHANGES          - changes from HITRAN2K to HITRAN04

To compile the programs, check the path to the Matlab "mex"
compiler (the default is /usr/local/matlab/bin) in the Makefile,
and simply type "make".  The resulting mex file needs to be on
the Matlab search path.
