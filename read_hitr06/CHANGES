         Changes From HITRAN2K to HITRAN04
         ---------------------------------


The data record for HITRAN04 was extended from 100 to 160 bytes.
The first 10 fields, IGAS, ISO, WNUM, STREN, TPROB, ABROAD, SBROAD,
ELS, ABCOEF, and TSP were unchanged.  The remaining six fields were
extended and three more fields were added, as follows.


    name    type       short description
   ------------------------------------------------
    IUSGQ    I3    upper state global quanta index
    ILSGQ    I3    lower state global quanta index
    USLQ     A9    upper state local quanta
    BSLQ     A9    lower state local quanta
    AI       3I1   accuracy indices
    REF      3I2   indices for lookup of references


    name    type       short description
   ------------------------------------------------
    IUSGQ    A15    upper state global quanta index
    ILSGQ    A15    lower state global quanta index
    USLQ     A15    upper state local quanta
    BSLQ     A15    lower state local quanta
    AI       6I1    accuracy indices
    REF      6I2    indices for lookup of references
    FLAG     A1     flag for line mixing
    SWUS     F7.1   statistical weight, upper state
    SWLS     F7.1   statistical weight, lower state

Note that the AI and REF fields are defined as ints, but are
returned by both the old and new reader as character arrays.

The name of the non-mexized matlab reader was changed to 
read_hitran2.m.  It should function identically to the mexized
version; the script htest.m can be used to verify this.
